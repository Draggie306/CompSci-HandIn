        <div class="article-content-row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>There are 39 voicelines, and an additional 12 optional extras. There are two "characters", the player and the narrator.</p>
                <p>Sections with “narration” are to be acted in the tone a very slightly mysterious narrator “looking down” on the simulation. Sections with “VO” are to be from the perspective of the player, i.e. reactions to the events in the game.</p>
                <p>Additional cues are [between brackets]. These are only a guide, as you are the voice actor, you will get to decide how your character(s) should be presented. I have a few ideas if you want extra help for each line, but that’s optional. You are in control of your characters!</p>
                <p>The same voice will not be used for the narration and the VO. These will be randomised for each playthrough.</p>
                <p><i>Compensation: I will not be making anyhing from the game. However, all voice actors will be given access to early testing, credit in the game itself, and the game for free on release (summer hols).</i></p>
                <p><i>Voicelines must be recorded with a HD microphone in a quiet ambient area.</i></p>

        <h2>Narrator Voicelines</h2>
        <div class="article-content-row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>How to Play narration</h3>
                <p>"You can use your typical WASD keys to move around, and the mouse to look around.<br> Use the spacebar to jump, the left mouse button to grapple onto objects, and "E" to interact with objects. Good luck out there."</p>

                <h3>Starter dialogue narration</h3>
                <p>"Welcome to the simulation! Or, as we like to call it, the "game"…” [mysterious]</p>
                <p>"Beyond the next horizon lies a challenge untold. Will you rise as the tide, or like so many before, recede into the Dangerous Depths?" * [mysterious]</p>
                <p>"You're just here to collect some tokens, right? Easy peasy!" * [lighthearted, teasing tone, as if you're sharing an inside joke with the player]</p>
                <p>"Oh, did I mention that water will be constantly rising? You'll need to keep moving around to dodge it." [somewhat sarcastic]</p>
                <p>"You can collect powerful tokens scattered seldomly around the map to fight back against the water." [informative, statement]</p>
                <p>"A word of warning, every time you collect a token, the physics of this simulation - I mean, game - will change. Be careful!"</p>

                <h3>Gameplay dialogue narration</h3>
                <p>"The simulation will end and you will be extracted back to reality in ten minutes. That is, unless you become enveloped first..."</p>
                <p>"You're halfway there!"</p>
                <p>"Just one singular token remains, a key to your return. Can you claim it?" *</p>
                <p>"All tokens have been collected! We're sending the extraction team now, give us a minute..."</p>
                <p>"Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One...!"</p>
                <p>"Initiating countdown: Ten to one, let's reverse the run. Ready to return to where we begun?" * [mysterious]</p>
                <p>"Congratulations! You've made it out alive!" [happy, surprised]</p>
                <p>"Thanks for playing!"</p>
                <p>"The simulation has ended. Want to play again?"</p>

                <h3>Token pickup narration</h3>
                <p>"You've picked up a token! The simulation will change..." * [happy -> mysterious]</p>
                <p>"Another token! The simulation will change..." *</p>
                <p>"Wow, you're on a roll!" * [lighthearted, upbeat tone]</p>
                <p>"Oooh, this is getting interesting..."</p>
                <p>"Oh yeah! Keep it up!"</p>
                <p>"You're doing great!" *</p>
                <p>"You're unstoppable!"</p>
                <p>"Boom! Another token!"</p>
                <p>"A token in hand, the world expands. A leap, a stand, fate's in your hands." [mysterious]</p>
                <p>"A token caught, the plot thickens, in this game, there are no givens." * [mysterious]</p>
                <p>"A token more, the stakes are high, beneath the surface, truths lie." * [mysterious]</p>

                <h3>Water rising damage narration</h3>
                <p><i>note: all to be in an urgent, condescending tone</i></p>
                <p>"The water's rising!"</p>
                <p>"This doesn't look good..."</p>
                <p>"You're getting wet!"</p>
                <p>"You're taking critical damage!"</p>
                <p>"Get to higher ground!"</p>
                <p>"Get to higher ground ASAP!"</p>
                <p>"Get out of the water!"</p>
                <p>"You're drowning!"</p>
                <p>"You don't want to be underwater for too long!"</p>
                <p>"You don't have gills, you know!"</p>
                <p>"You're not a fish!"</p>
                <p>"Ouch! That looked painful. Perhaps consider a strategy that involves less... submersion?" [sarcastic]</p>
