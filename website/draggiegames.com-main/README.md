This is the repository for the alpha.draggiegames.com website.

## Assets
For the JavaScript assets, go to the "js" subfolder

For the CSS stylesheets, go to the "css" subfolder.

The HTML files are in the root of the folder.

## How to run
The website uses static files, which means that no server is required to change the served HTML on the fly.

As a result of this, you should be able to simply download the files, open up index.html in the browser, and interact from there.

There may be some link issues. This is because the site is deployed on Cloudflare Pages. To run the site on there (free):

1) create a cloudflare account at https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/.
2) Go to Workers and Pages on the left side of the screen
3) Create a new Pages application
4) Upload the files in this repository - drag the top-level folder into the app
5) Deploy it
6) Visit your chosen domain URL (you may need to wait for DNS propagation)
7) Profit
