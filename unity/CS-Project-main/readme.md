# Unity Project

For simplicity, this folder only contains the files in `SceneScripts` and `SceneAssets` folders. The rest of the project is not included due to GitHub's size limitations but is available via usb or google drive/another cloud service.

## SceneScripts
Contains all the C# source code files for the project. Some are in subfolders depending on the scene they are used in.

## SceneAssets
Some of the assets used in the project and the scenes they are in.
